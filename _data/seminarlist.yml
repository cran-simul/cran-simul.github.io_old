   title: Learning high-level reasoning in vision, language and robotics
   abstract: "An important sub goal of AI is the creation of intelligent agents, which require high-level reasoning capabilities, situation awareness, and the capacity of robustly taking the right decisions at the right moments. An exact definition of the term reasoning is difficult, but we define it as the opposite of exploiting spurious biases and short-cuts in training data picked up by low-level statistics, and which could lead to dramatic losses in generalization beyond the training data.

   In this talk we will cover the automatic learning reasoning capabilities through large-scale training of deep neural networks from data, and we target different situations, like robotics and embodied computer vision (robot navigation to solve visual tasks) as well as vision and language reasoning (visual question answering). We explore this problem in a holistic way and study it from various angles of attack: what are the tasks which lead to emergence of reasoning? How can we evaluate agents and measure reasoning vs. bias exploitation? How can we x-ray neural models and visualize their internal behavior? What are the bottlenecks in learning reasoning? Can we structure neural networks with inductive bias to improve the emergence of reasoning, by including prior knowledge on geometry, physics, or semantics?"

   title: Smoothing (Large) Graph Signals using Random Forests
   abstract: A natural way of denoising graph signals is to penalise local variation using the graph Laplacian. Because this has worst-case cost O(n^3) in the number of nodes, exact methods cannot be used for very large graphs. I'll show how a simple stochastic process can be used to obtain fast unbiased estimators for the smoothed signal. I'll introduce some variance reduction techniques, including a gradient-descent technique that works more generally whenever an unbiased estimator of a least-squares problem is available.

   title: "Hypersphere Fitting: Model, Algorithms and Future Work"
   abstract: "We will present a recent EM algorithm for hypersphere fitting based on a von Mises-Fisher prior. The algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art. In addition, it can be easily robustified to mitigate the presence of potential outliers. After presenting some results obtained with this algorithm, we will discuss some open issues related to the application to LiDAR point clouds. These open issues include the consideration of mixtures of hyperspheres, the segmentation and denoising of LiDAR point clouds and the fusion of point clouds with RGB images"

   title: "Robust Linearly Constrained Filtering and Smoothing: Results and Applications"
   abstract: "It is well-known that Wiener and Kalman filter (KF) like techniques are sensitive to misspecified covariances, uncertainties in the system matrices and parameters, filter initialization or unexpected system behaviors induced by time-varying environments, harsh propagation conditions, malicious interferences or unmodeled inputs. In this talk we introduce a possible solution to robustify these estimation techniques through linear constraints (LCs): i) we detail the linearly constrained KF (LCKF), where a set of non-stationary LCs can be set at every time step, ii) we show how to use such LCs to mitigate modeling errors in general mismatched linear discrete state-space models, and iii) we point the reader to some recent LCKF extensions (i.e., information filter, invariant filter, linear smoother and  LC-extended/cubature-KF). Some applications of interest are provided to support the discussion: robust array processing, GNSS position and attitude estimation, invariant navigation and visual SLAM."

   title: Low-Rank Inverse Problems in Brain Signal Processing
   abstract: "The presentation will start by introducing the basics principles of biophysics allowing to model the electrophysiological brain measurements (EEG / SEEG / micro-electrodes), and more precisely the relations between the neural current sources and the electrodes. Once the signal model defined, I will briefly present some of the classical methods for solving the inverse problem of brain sources estimation (localization and activity), and I will focus next on our work on sparse approximations and low-rank (exact and approximate) source estimates."

   title: Inférence et décomposition de graphes dynamiques en neurosciences
   abstract: "Dynamic graphs make it possible to understand the evolution of complex systems which evolve through time. In this thesis, we look at their applications to understand one of the most common neurological disorder in the world, affecting around 1% of the population: epilepsy. A complete and objective characterization of the patient-specific dynamic graph describing this pathology is crucial for optimal surgical treatment. First, we propose to modify a measure of functional connectivity, the Phase-Locking-Value, in order to infer robust dynamic graph from the neurophysiological signal recorded during an epileptic seizure. Constrained matrix decomposition method is applied to extract the principal features from the dynamic graph describing the pathology. Finally, a clinical study is performed to compare the obtained features from the visual interpretation of a clinician specialized in neurophysiological signal interpretation."

  title: Should we use quaternion neural networks? Recent advances and limitations.
  abstract: Real-world data used to train modern artificial neural networks reflect the complexity of the environment that we are evolving in. As a consequence, they are neither flat, nor decorrelated nor one dimensional. Instead, scientists have to deal with composed and multidimensional entities, that are characterized by multiple related components, such as color channels describing a single color pixel of an image, or the 3D coordinates of a point denoting the position of a robot. Surprisingly, recent advances on deep learning are mainly focused on developing novel architectures to extract even more relevant and robust high level representations from the input features, while the latter are still poorly considered at a lower and basic level, by being processed with one dimensional real-valued neural models. Neural networks based on complex and quaternion numbers have been used sparsely for many decades. Nonetheless, due to new statements and proofs about the benefits of these models over real-valued ones on many real-world tasks, quaternion based neural networks have been increasingly employed, and novel quaternion based architectures have been proposed. This talk will detail quaternion neural networks architectures for artificial intelligence related tasks, such as image processing, or speech recognition, by introducing first the basics of quaternion numbers, and then describing recent advances on quaternion neural networks with the quaternion convolutional (Interspeech 2018, ICASSP 2019) and recurrent neural networks (ICLR 2019, Interspeech 2020). This presentation will also show their benefits in terms of performances obtained in different tasks, as well as in terms of neural parameters required for learning. Finally, the talk will outline important future research directions to turn quaternion neural networks into a mandatory alternative to real-valued models for real-world tasks.

  title: Optimal sensor placement for signal extraction
  abstract: Many signal processing problems can be cast from a generic setting where a source signal propagates through a given environment to some sensors. Under this setting, we can be interested either in (i) estimating the source signal, or (ii) the environment, or even (iii) the resulting field of signals in some regions of the environment. In all these cases, signals are recorded by multiple sensors located at different positions. Due to price, energy, or ergonomic constraints, the number of sensors is often limited and it becomes crucial to place a few sensors at positions that contain the maximum information. This problem corresponds to optimal sensor placement and it appears in a great number of applications. The way to tackle the problem of optimal sensor placement depends on which of the three aspects mentioned above we want to address. In this talk, we focus on estimating a source signal from a set of noisy measurements collected from a limited number of sensors, and we present new criteria as well as algorithms. Specifically, our first proposed criterion maximizes the average signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the estimated signal, and we experimentally show that the performance obtained by this criterion outperforms the results obtained using classical Kriging-based methods. Since the SNR is uncertain in this context, to achieve a robust signal extraction, we propose a second placement criterion based on the maximization of the probability that the output SNR exceeds a given threshold. This criterion can be easily evaluated using a Gaussian process assumption for the signal, the noise, and the environment. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of the joint maximization of the criterion with respect to all sensor positions, we propose a greedy algorithm where the sensor positions are sequentially (i.e. one by one) selected. Finally, for improving the sub-optimal greedy algorithm, we present an optimization approach to locate all the sensors at once. For this purpose, we add a constraint to the problem that can control the average distances between the sensors. To solve our problem, we use an alternating optimization penalty method.

  title: "Mes expériences dans la télédétection radar : la Terre depuis le ciel, le ciel depuis la Terre, et comment profiter des deux ?"
  abstract: "La télédétection radar est une discipline qui repose sur le traitement du signal, d'images et de données, et sur la physique. Caractérisée par les nombreuses spécificités par rapport aux autres moyens de télédétection, cette discipline s'est montrée indispensable dans l'observation de la Terre et de l'atmosphère. De plus, il s'agit d'un domaine qui a motivé et permis de nombreux travaux de recherche concernant l'analyse statistique du signal, d'images et de données. Nikola Besic partagera avec nous certaines de ces expériences dans l'observation de la Terre depuis le ciel, et dans l'observation du ciel depuis la Terre, au moyen de radar. La première partie de son exposé adresse alors les travaux effectués sur le sujet du Radar à Synthèse d'Ouverture, satellitaire et polarimétrique, qui incluent la problématique des modèles statistiques et de la décomposition, ainsi que l'application dans le contexte des études de la cryosphère. La deuxième partie concerne plutôt l'observation de l'atmosphère avec un radar toujours polarimétrique, mais cette fois-ci terrestre, et ses efforts de trouver un compromis entre la physique et l'apprentissage automatique à partir de données, dans un contexte des méthodes de classification semi-supervisée."
